Other languages use almost exactly the same model: library and function names may differ, but the concepts are the same. We've obviously been doing this the entire time, but this will give us a clearer picture of what else you can do when interacting with a database through python.\n",

    "The program starts by importing the sqlite3 library. If we were connecting to MySQL, DB2, or some other database, we would import a different library, but all of them provide the same functions, so that the rest of our program does not have to change (at least, not much) if we switch from one database to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 2 establishes a connection to the database. Since we’re using SQLite, all we need to specify is the name of the database file. Other systems may require us to provide a username and password as well. Line 3 then uses this connection to create a cursor. Just like the cursor in an editor, its role is to keep track of where we are in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "On line 4, we use that cursor to ask the database to execute a query for us. The query is written in SQL, and passed to cursor.execute as a string. It’s our job to make sure that SQL is properly formatted; if it isn’t, or if something goes wrong when it is being executed, the database will report an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database returns the results of the query to us in response to the cursor.fetchall call on line 5. This result is a list with one entry for each record in the result set; if we loop over that list (line 6) and print those list entries (line 7), we can see that each one is a tuple with one element for each field we asked for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, lines 8 and 9 close our cursor and our connection, since the database can only keep a limited number of these open at one time. Since establishing a connection takes time, though, we shouldn’t open a connection, do one operation, then close the connection, only to reopen it a few microseconds later to do another operation. Instead, it’s normal to create one connection that stays open for the lifetime of the program.\n",
